# Anime-Sama-Downloader

## How to use (Currently not the instruction is not update i will do it soon)
- If you want to use the downloader is very simple you need to go at [Anime Sama](https://anime-sama.org)
- Then sreach the anime you want to download for exemple [Frieren](https://anime-sama.org/catalogue/frieren/)
- After click on the saison you want to download (here it one beacause Frieren as no Saison 2 currently) so [Frieren Saison 1](https://anime-sama.org/catalogue/frieren/saison1/vostfr/)
- And then you click on the saison you want take the link and give them to the downloader

## How pull the repo
simply do this command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TMCooper/Anime-Sama-Downloader.git --recurse-submodules
```

## Update

- Rework of the project and new approche with an api [AnimeSamaApi](https://github.com/TMCooper/AnimeSamaApi/)

- Now the downloader is aproximatly x2 or x3 more faster thant the previouse version (aproximatly 30 mn fort 12 episode i gess i m not sure about this stats but we are surly close)

## Warning
- If you see a message like : ```Looks like Playwright was just installed or updated. Please run the following command to download new browsers: playwright install <3 Playwright Team``` just do (in the env) : 
```bash
playwright install
```
and all is normaly good you can use the software !
